![Nota](/projects/nota.jpg)

From the Latin word _Nota_ which means "Label", this project aims to provide an open-source solution that will allow data annotation in a collaborative manner but also automate the process leveraging **AI models**.

The project has three main goals:

- üåç Allow collaborative data annotation
- ü§ñ Use AI models as annotators
- üì¶ Support a wide range of data providers (local files, S3-based storage,...)
