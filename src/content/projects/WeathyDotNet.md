WeathyDotNet is a CLI tool built with **C#** that provides a given location's weather using _OpenWeather_'s API.

The tool can also be installed as a native command on your machine after a building it with the following instructions:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global --add-source ./nupkg WeathyDotNet
```

To see it in action, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
weathy <city_name>
```

_PS: you'll need an API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) to use the tool._
